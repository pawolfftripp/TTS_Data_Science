Hello! My Name is Perry, and I am taking this class to force structure (no more "will do it tomorrow"),
and move into a career path that allows me the comfort of being home at the end of the day instead of all over the country. Afterall, 12+ years of being on the road 
and relocating constantly gets very old!
